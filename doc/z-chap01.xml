      Introduction
    </Heading>

    This is the manual for the &Semigroups; package for &GAP; version &VERSION;.
    &Semigroups; &VERSION; is a distant descendant of the
    <URL Text = "Monoid package for GAP 3">
      http://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/index.html</URL> by Goetz Pfeiffer,
    Steve A. Linton, Edmund F. Robertson, and Nik Ruskuc.<P/>

    &Semigroups; &VERSION; contains efficient methods for creating semigroups,
    monoids, inverse semigroups and their ideals, calculating their Green's
    structure, size, elements, group of units, minimal ideal, and testing
    membership, finding the inverses of a regular element, and factorizing
    elements over the generators, and much more; see below for more details.
    <P/>

    There are methods for finding: congruences of semigroups, the normalizer of
    a semigroup in a permutation group (using the method from <Cite Key =
      "Araujo2010aa"/>), the maximal subsemigroups of a finite semigroup (based
    on <Cite Key = "Graham1968aa"/> and described in <Cite Key =
      "Donoven2016aa"/>), smaller degree partial permutation representations
    (based on <Cite Key = "Schein1992aa"/>) and the character table of an
    inverse semigroup.  There are functions for producing pictures of the
    Green's structure of a semigroup (inspired by 
    <Alt Not='Text'><URL
        Text='sgpviz'>https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/sgpviz.html</URL></Alt><Alt
      Only='Text'><Package>sgpviz</Package></Alt>), and for drawing graphical
    representations of the elements of certain semigroups. <P/>

    Many standard examples of semigroups and classes of semigroups are
    provided; see Section <Ref Sect = "Standard examples"/>.  &Semigroups; also
    provides functions to read and write collections of elements of a semigroup
    to a file; see <Ref Func = "ReadGenerators"/> and <Ref Func =
      "WriteGenerators"/>.
    <P/>

    There are functions in &Semigroups; to define and manipulate free
    inverse semigroups and free bands; this part of the package was written
    by Julius Jonu&#353;as; see Chapters <Ref Chap = "Free objects"/>.
    <P/>
    
    There are three fundamental types of algorithms in the &Semigroups; package,
    those for semigroups of:
    <Enum>
      <Item>
        transformations, partial permutations, bipartitions, subsemigroups
        of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over groups, and matrices over a
        finite field. When applied to semigroups with large subgroups these are
        the most efficient methods in the &Semigroups; package. For example,
        the complexity of computing, say, the size of a transformation
        semigroup that happens to be a group, is the same as the complexity of
        the Schreier-Sims Algorithm (polynomial in the number of points acted
        on by the transformations) for a permutation group. <P/>

        The algorithms of this type are described in <Cite Key =
          "East2015aa"/>. In theory, these algorithms can be applied to
        compute any subsemigroup of a regular semigroup; but so far in the
        &Semigroups; package they are only applied to the types of semigroups
        mentioned above.   <!--For details of how to
        extend &Semigroups; see <Ref Chap = "Extending the package"/>.-->  We
        refer to semigroups to which the algorithms in <Cite Key =
          "East2015aa"/> can be applied as <E>acting semigroups</E>.  See
        Section <Ref Sect = "Acting semigroups"/> for further details.

        partitioned binary relations as defined in <Cite

        A version of the Froidure-Pin Algorithm <Cite Key = "Froidure1997aa"/>
        from the &libsemigroups; C++ library is used to compute semigroups of
        these types.  This algorithm outperforms the algorithms for acting
        semigroups when applied to semigroups with small (trivial) subgroups.
        This method is used to determine the structure of a semigroup to when
        the algorithms described in <Cite Key = "East2015aa"/> do not apply. It
        is possible to specify which methods should be applied to a given
        semigroup; see Section 
        <Ref Sect = "Options when creating semigroups"/>.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        any other semigroup in &GAP; with representation <Ref
          Filt="IsEnumerableSemigroupRep"/>. A version of the Froidure-Pin
        Algorithm <Cite Key = "Froidure1997aa"/> (written in C within the
        &Semigroups; package) is used to compute semigroups of this type.
        Mostly due to the way that &GAP; handles memory, this implementation is
        approximately 4 times slower than the implementation in &libsemigroups;
        when applied to semigroups of the types given in <E>2</E>.  This
        version of the Froidure-Pin Algorithm is included because it applies to
        a wider class of semigroups than those currently implemented in
        &libsemigroups; and it is more straightforward to extend the classes of
        semigroup to which it applies. 
      </Item>
    </Enum>

    <B>Minor note of caution</B>: &Semigroups; contains different methods for
    some &GAP; library functions, and so you might notice that &GAP; behaves
    differently when &Semigroups; is loaded.  For more details about semigroups
    in &GAP; or Green's relations in particular, see <Ref Sect = "Semigroups"
      BookName = "ref"/> or <Ref Sect = "Green's Relations" BookName = "ref"/>.
